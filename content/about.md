title: About me
---

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Joe. I'm a front-end web developer by trade, but I like to experiment in a bunch of different languages. I'm skilled in Javascript, PHP, C++ and Go.

Currently, I'm working at a digital agency, building e-commerce sites for clients.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jccit) profile. I post small projects there that I'm working on in my spare time.
