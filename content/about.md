ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Joe. I work as a front end dev, so expect a lot of projects and posts to do with JS and CSS. It's not just all web dev, I'm experimenting with other languages too, you can see some of my work on the projects page.

Currently, I'm working at a digital agency, building e-commerce sites for clients.

Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/jccit) profile. I post small projects there that I'm working on in my spare time.
